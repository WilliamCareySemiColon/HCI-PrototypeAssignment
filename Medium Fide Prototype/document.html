		This document will explain some of the features of the html files in this document. 
		It will deal with what is common between the pages before going into each unique page
	</p>

	<h2>What is common between all the pages</h2>
	<p>
		Each of the pages has a logo, address, a search bar, a dropdown list and a slideshow in the header.
		The body has pictures and the footer has the same content. Most of the functionality is in the header.
		The search bar, once the search bar is entered in, will redirect you to  the home page. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The dropdown menu have links to three other pages and itself. The four pages are home page, gallery page, 
		login and current students page. All the other parts are just placeholder. The slideshow demonstrates the 
		ability to look through some photos. They are not links themselves but can be altered to become so. The bodies 
		images are links but are currently placeholder. Some wording are just placeholder. The images are aligned so
		they are visually appealing
	</p>

	<p>In terms of layout, the index and the gallery page are the same</p>

	<h2>Current page</h2>
	<p>
		The one unique part of current student page is there is an image that link to the login image. Other than that is the same
	</p>

	<h2>Login page</h2>
	<p>
		If you type enter on the login page, it redirects to the home page.
